<p><strong>CAMHS</strong><br />
Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services provided by NHS Scotland.
Services are provided by teams of clinicians including psychiatrists,
mental health nurses, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists
and other allied health professionals. These services are based mainly
in outpatient clinics and in the community. CAMHS are multi-disciplinary
teams that provide treatment and/or interventions for children and young
people experiencing mental health problems. Where a child or young
person is awaiting an assessment for a neurodevelopmental condition such
as ASD, or ADHD, they may not be appropriate for CAMHS. This is because
they do not meet the National Referral Criteria as described in the
CAMHS national service specification and may instead be referred onto a
neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway. This release does not report on the
neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway including those children and young
people on the neurodevelopmental waiting list.</p>
<p><strong>Children and young people</strong><br />
The people served by CAMHS. Some areas provide services for all those
under 18, while others offer services to those over 16 only if they are
in full time education.</p>
<p><strong>Psychological Therapies</strong><br />
Psychological Therapies refer to a range of interventions, based on
psychological concepts and theory, which are designed to help people
understand and make changes to their thinking, behaviour, and
relationships in order to relieve distress and to improve functioning.
The standard applies specifically to psychological therapies for
treatment of a mental illness or disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Key variables</strong><br />
The combination of identifying variables - including ‘UCPN’ and
‘CHI’/‘UPI’ - allowing a patient pathway to be created, which enables
further analysis in CAPTND.</p>
<p><strong>Mean</strong><br />
The arithmetical average value i.e. total of a number of values / the
total number of values.</p>
<p><strong>Median</strong><br />
The middle value when the data values in a dataset are ranked in
increasing (or decreasing) order of magnitude.</p>
<p><strong>Total appointments</strong><br />
The total number of appointments recorded in CAPTND, whether attended or
not. An individual can have more than one appointment on a given
day.</p>
<p><strong>First contact appointment</strong><br />
The first appointment date that appears in an individual’s care
pathway.</p>
<p><strong>DNA Rate</strong><br />
Did not attend (DNA) refers to appointments in which a patient did not
attend and gave no prior warning. The DNA rate is the proportion of
appointments for which this occurs out of all appointments in a given
period. If for first contact appointments only this is referred to as
the <em>first contact DNA rate</em>.</p>
