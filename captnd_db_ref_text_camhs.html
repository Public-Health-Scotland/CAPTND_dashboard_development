<p>For the quarter ending November 2025, there were a total of 7,607
individuals referred to PT recorded in CAPTND across NHSScotland. This
was a decrease of 533 (6.5%) compared with the previous quarter, and an
increase of 4,621 (154.8%) compared with the same quarter ending
November 2024.</p>
<p>For some health boards referral numbers may appear to have increased
sharply over the past five quarters, which may be reflective of improved
data quality of submissions allowing more pathways to be counted in
CAPTND, rather than necessarily representing an actual increase in
service demand.</p>
<p>CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution. Note that
referral numbers represent those patients for whom it was possible to
construct a pathway in CAPTND, and may therefore be under-representative
of total referrals at health board level. See Glossary section to
explain differences between Official statistics and Official statistics
in development.</p>
