<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This publication of statistics in development presents information
relating to activity in Psychological Therapies (PT) and Child and
Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) from the Child, Adolescent,
and Psychological Therapies National Dataset (CAPTND). Data is presented
at NHS board and Scotland-level. In this publication, ‘Scotland-level’
refers to the aggregated regional NHS board figures that are available
in CAPTND.</p>
<p>CAPTND is a dataset in development that collates information for
mental health services at patient-level and records each individual’s
journey through the service. CAPTND data are still under development
therefore any inferences or conclusions from this analysis must be
treated with caution, and should not be compared to the official
aggregate collection and waiting time for <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/psychological-therapies-waiting-times/psychological-therapies-waiting-times-quarter-ending-march-2025/">PT</a>
and <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-camhs-waiting-times/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-camhs-waiting-times-quarter-ending-march-2025/">CAMHS</a>.</p>
<p>This report relates to the period July 2024 to September 2025.</p>

<h2>Data Quality</h2>
<p>Good quality data are crucial for accuracy and interpretation, and
Public Health Scotland is working with all NHS boards to implement
robust data collection for CAPTND. Some data items, namely ‘UCPN’,
‘UPI’, and ‘CHI’, are required to create a unique and complete care
pathway for an individual within CAPTND (see <a href="#variables-reported">Variables Reported</a> section below). For
records where these key variables are not available the pathway cannot
be created accurately and cannot, therefore, be used in CAPTND analysis.
A comparison of referral counts before and after pathway creation can be
found in the accompanying <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-captnd/psychological-therapies-in-child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-2-september-2025/">data
quality documents</a></p>
<p>Data returns for CAPTND began in June 2019, and following extensive
data quality checking and collaboration with NHS boards data quality
improved sufficiently by January 2020 to enable initial and limited
reporting to commence. Improving data quality in CAPTND is an ongoing
process, meaning data from previous quarters may not be comparable to
the current reporting period.</p>
<p>As the development of CAPTND progresses, greater detail on
individuals’ journeys within PT and CAMHS will be reported.</p>

<h2>Variables Reported</h2>
<p>See the <a href="#glossary">Glossary</a> for definitions of
terminology and derived values.</p>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Unique Care Pathway Number (UCPN):</strong> An identifier
allocated to new referrals to a consultant-led, nurse-led, or other
service, to enable identification of patient pathways. These are only
unique <em>within</em> NHS boards.</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Community Health Index (CHI):</strong> The <a href="https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/community_health_index_number.html">Community
Health Index (CHI)</a> is a population register, which is used in
Scotland for health care purposes. The CHI number uniquely identifies a
person on the index, the first six digits of the CHI number relate to
the person’s date of birth (DD MM YY).</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Unique Patient Identifier (UPI):</strong> The UPI is a
locally-generated code used to uniquely identify a patient in cases
where the CHI number is not available.</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Sex:</strong> Biological sex as recorded at birth. ‘Not
known’ refers to indeterminate sex at birth, including intersex. The use
of ‘Not specified’ refers to instances where the information is not
available.</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Age group:</strong> Age in years is calculated at the point
of referral from reported date of birth. When date of birth is not
reported, the first six digits of the CHI number are used. Age is then
grouped into 5-year age categories for reporting purposes.</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>SIMD quintile:</strong> <a href="https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/">Scottish
Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)</a> is a postcode-derived measure
of relative deprivation. If an area is identified as ‘deprived’, this
can relate to residents having a low income, but it can also mean fewer
resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area is
deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health,
access to services, crime and housing. Residence in a deprived postcode
area does not necessarily mean an individual themselves experiences
deprivation. Not all patients are treated in their NHS board of
residence. Please note that NHS board areas may not have all five
quintiles represented.</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Referral received date / Referral date:</strong> The date on
which a health or social care service receives a referral. If this
cannot be provided, ‘Referral date’ is used instead as these dates are
often very similar. If neither of these fields are provided the
individual’s record cannot be counted as it cannot be placed within the
time frame reported.</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Referral accepted:</strong> A categorical variable stating
whether an individual’s referral has been accepted, not accepted,
decision pending, or the information is missing.</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Referral non-acceptance reason:</strong> The reason why a
referral was not accepted by the service provider.</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Referral non-acceptance action:</strong> The action taken
following an initial referral not being accepted into the service.
Please note that these are data under development and may not be
recorded in all NHS boards.</p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Appointment date:</strong> The date on which an appointment
occurred or was planned to occur. The first appointment date in an
individual’s pathway is referred to as the <strong>first contact
appointment.</strong></p>
</div>
<div custom-style="Bullet 1">
<p><strong>Appointment attendance status:</strong> Indicates whether the
patient attended their appointment and provides context for
non-attendance. This is used to calculate Did Not Attend (DNA)
rates.</p>
</div>
